#1. Why is possible that Update and Delete Widget Requests may fail, even when you were 
running just one Consumer? 

If the dictionary is missing required fields, such as 'widgetId' or 'owner' then there will be errors in the code I wrote.

In a more general sense there could be errors with syncing as a message might not be updated or removed before another request is submitted.
As such there is a potential mix up where an update gets called on a message that is being deleted, or delete gets called on a message 
being updated.



#2. How would this possible behavior impact the design of distributed applications that use 
queues? 

If this was to happen there would be requests that failed which would result in unsatisfied users. Additionally, if the code was not written
to account for this then the program could potentially crash. To help avoid this the code should both be robust and use a dead letter queue.
